At the time, Zakum was a peaceful monster that had no enemies, but the greed of the miners corrupted it. As the spirit was corrupted, it grew smarter, and finally became capable of controlling the town's populace. It forced them to build an enormous statue in tribute to it. The now evil spirit of Zakum possessed the statue, subjugated all the humans and eventually killed everyone in the town. Zakum now rests deep in the lava caves, waiting for powerful players to challenge his might.",
